Making the sandwich

Take a bowl, mix the White mayonaise with chopped capcicum, chopped onion, chopped tomatoes and with grated carrot to make a filling for the sandwich.

Then apply this filling on a slice of bread and on the other side apply some Pasta Pizza Sauce and cover the other bread slice with this bread slice with pasta pizza sauce.

Then take a sandwicher and apply some butter on the bottom of it place the raw sandwich on it. Place some butter on top of the raw sandwich and then close the sandwicheR and let it cook.

After it is cooked take it out on a plate, cut it in two halves.

And then finally eat it.
